Necessary modules to be able to define a mechanism are:
- **mec2.core**
- **mec2.model**
- **mec2.nodes**
- **mec2.constraints**

All of them have to be imported for **mec2** to be usable.
It is mandatory for the **core** module to be loaded first.  
Please note that the **mec2.js** and **mec2.min.js** in the root of the project contain all modules, so no further imports are necessary.

### Core

The `core` module contains the central `mec` object on which all other modules build upon.

It provides the mechanism with:
- Parameters for numerical tolerances.
- Color modes (dark/light) and colors for the individual parts.
- Unit conversion functionality.
- An infrastructure for validation messages.
- Central configuration properties to show and hide certain elements.
- Centralized analyzing parameters for used metrics in calculations.

It is advised to use the properties given by the central `mec` object to minimize the overhead when changing the environment. Especially the analyzing capabilities minimize unit errors.

A `mec` model is respectively used as environment (`env`) for all models which are extended through it.

### Model

By importing `mec.model`, the `model` property is added to the `mec` object.
This property provides the `extend` function, which is designed
to assign `mec`'s prototype and thereby all functionality onto a provided
`model` object.

It is recommended to issue `model.extend` as early as possible to apply all required capabilities to the mechanism.
An empty model which is extended by `mec.model` references the `mec`  by its `env` property.

The mechanism model gets a lot of properties which are important for a mechanism:

- Operations on nodes, constraints, drives.
- Iteration functionality.
- Calculations for center of gravity.
- A timer.
- Ability to be drawn on a 2d context via g2.

Furthermore it provides the necessary infrastructure to call functions on
delegated modules;
e.g. by calling `init` on the `model`, the respective `init` functions on all
underlying elements like `nodes`, `constraints` etc. are called.

Therefore to import and extend the model using `model.extend` is a necessary step to create a fully functioning mechanism.

For nodes and constraints (and all other modules) to be delegated in the `model` it is of course necessary to import the respective modules.

### Nodes

`nodes` are two dimensional particles.

<!-- TODO die gif is mist... -->


They are described by the following properties:
- `id` - A unique id to identify single nodes. Ambiguities are not allowed.
- `x` and `y` - Cartesian coordinates in relation to the origin.
- `base` - A boolean parameter which sets the weight to positive infinity (ground). Default: `false`.
- `mass` - An optional parameter to set the mass of the node. Default: 1kg. Please note that `mass` can not be 0.

Velocity and acceleration can not be determined beforehand, but they are calculated in the simulation process and can be fetched at all times.

There are no interactions between nodes, except the ones defined by `constraints`, therefore `nodes` have two degrees of freedom if they are unconstrained.

To get an idea of the implementation of nodes the following code suffices to draw them on a dedicated context.

```json
{   
	"nodes": [
        { "id": "A0", "x": 75, "y": 100, "base": true },
        { "id": "A", "x": 75, "y": 150 },
        { "id": "B", "x": 275, "y": 220 },
        { "id": "B0", "x": 275, "y": 100, "base": true },
        { "id": "C", "x": 125, "y": 225 }
    ]
}
```

{   
	"nodes": [
        { "id": "A0", "x": 75, "y": 100, "base": true },
        { "id": "A", "x": 75, "y": 150 },
        { "id": "B", "x": 275, "y": 220 },
        { "id": "B0", "x": 275, "y": 100, "base": true },
        { "id": "C", "x": 125, "y": 225 }
    ]
}
</mec-2>


## Constraints

`constraints` define the type of interactions of two `nodes`.
Provided a pair of `nodes`, constraints are defined by their `id`, using them as properties `p1` and `p2`.

`constraints` have two properties to limit the movement of the respective `nodes`:

- `ori` - The constraint allows changes in orientation, but not in length.
- `len` - The constraint allows changes in length, but not in orientation.

Both properties are given as objects, which have a at least a `type`.
Without extra modules, the `type` can be set as `const` or `free`, limiting the model in the respective range of motion. By the usage of other modules, e.g. `mec2.drive` the type can be set as `drive`, to force a specific motion.

Constraints are made available by importing the `mec2.constraints` module.
